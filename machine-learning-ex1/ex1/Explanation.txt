h(x) will give you the hypothesis

now what we really need to do is to update theta

where
theta (j)=theta(j)- alpha*delta

where delta is the rate of change of J(theta0,theta1)

to find delta we have the formula as told by Andrew
which is 
delta=(1/m)*summation(h(x)^(j)-y(j)) *x(j)

instead of doing the summation of (h(x)-y) we can do a matrix multiplication ie
hx = X*theta -y
where X is an m*2 matrix where x0 is the first feature and x1 is the second feature 
      theta is a 2*1 matrix with theta1 and theta2
      y is a m*1 matrix

thus getting a matrix which contains difference of all the hypothesis and the real y

hx will be a (m*1) matrix

now substituting this in the equation of delta;

delta=(1/m)*(X*theta-y)'*X;

now finally for updating theta

theta =theta- alpha*delta;
